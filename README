This is not my complete home directory, of course.  I'm using symbolic links to
wire stuff into the right place.  Once you have this project, run setup.sh.
Don't worry, it's idempotent, I think.

Tools
=====

Maven
-----
brew install maven

The command line tool is 'mvn'.


IntelliJ IDEA
-------------

I'll be needing to add environment variables for the IDE, since it is started
by launchd.

  launchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME $ANDROID_HOME
